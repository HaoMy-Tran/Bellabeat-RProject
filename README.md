# Bellabeat project: How can a wellness company play it smart?

This project is completed under the umbrella of Google Data Analytics Professtional Certificate. 
As a newbie in data analysis field, it took me a certain amount of time to get familiar with the data analysis process and the use programming languages (which is R in this project). By trials and errors, at some senses, this project was finally completed. However, this is not comprehensive and it needs to be developed.

In this case study, I will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I will analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. My analysis will help guide future marketing strategies for Bellabeat's team.
